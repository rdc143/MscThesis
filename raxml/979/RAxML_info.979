IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 18152 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 column that contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file window.fa.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 1 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
