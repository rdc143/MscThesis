IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 56 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file window.fa.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 56 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
