IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 1452 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 22589 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 22591 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file window.fa.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 3 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
