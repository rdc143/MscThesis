IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 38 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file mtdna.fa.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 38 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 5518 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 5.51%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 20 inferences on the original alignment using 20 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
